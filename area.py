#Question No. 7:
#Write a Python program to find the area of a triangle.

#First we declare our desired variables variables to find area of triangle.

base = int(input("Enter the base of the triangle :"))
height = int(input("Enter the height of the triangle :"))

# Declare the formula of area to find area.
area = (1/2)*base*height

#Now we use print function to calculate area of triangle.
print("Area of triangle is:",area)

# Run the program.
# Done!
